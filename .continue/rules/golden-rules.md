- Always propose diffs, never rewrite whole files.
- For multi-file edits: plan first, then one file at a time.
- If unsure about file names or structure: ask before coding.
- When touching >1 file, list dependencies first.
- Avoid duplicating files and codes. If a code already exists you should either use it or update it if needed.
- I'm not a coder. I only provide logic and human test. Work with me in a simple way (for dummies)
